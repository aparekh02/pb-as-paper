SPECIFIC FINDINGS:

1. LEAD (Pb) INFILTRATION:
   -------------------------
   ✓ Bulk density is the PRIMARY controlling factor (10.4x stronger than pH)
   ✓ Lower bulk density = MORE infiltration (negative correlation)
   ✓ Higher pH reduces Pb mobility but effect is WEAK
   ✓ Statistical significance: Both relationships are significant, but
     bulk density is HIGHLY significant (p<0.0001)

2. ARSENIC (As) INFILTRATION:
   ---------------------------
   ✓ Bulk density is the PRIMARY controlling factor (7.7x stronger than pH)
   ✓ Lower bulk density = MORE infiltration (negative correlation)
   ✓ Higher pH INCREASES As mobility (opposite effect from Pb)
   ✓ Statistical significance: Both relationships are significant, but
     bulk density is HIGHLY significant (p<0.0001)


MECHANISTIC EXPLANATION:
-----------------------
Bulk Density controls infiltration through PHYSICAL mechanisms:
• Lower bulk density → Higher porosity
• Higher porosity → More pore space and pathways
• More pathways → Enhanced water and contaminant infiltration
• Result: Heavy metals more easily penetrate soil during runoff events

pH controls infiltration through CHEMICAL mechanisms:
• pH affects surface charge and sorption capacity
• For Pb: Higher pH → Stronger binding → Less mobility
• For As: Higher pH → Desorption → More mobility
• However, these chemical effects are SECONDARY to physical porosity


================================================================================
PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR RUNOFF MANAGEMENT
================================================================================

1. SOIL COMPACTION MANAGEMENT:
   • Avoiding excessive soil compaction is CRITICAL
   • Compacted soils (high bulk density) reduce infiltration
   • Loose/porous soils (low bulk density) increase contamination risk

2. pH MANAGEMENT:
   • For Pb contamination: Maintaining higher pH (>7) helps reduce mobility
   • For As contamination: Lower pH may reduce mobility, but effect is weak
   • pH adjustment alone is NOT sufficient for contamination control

3. RISK ASSESSMENT PRIORITY:
   • Assess soil bulk density FIRST when evaluating infiltration risk
   • Consider pH as a SECONDARY factor
   • Focus remediation efforts on controlling porosity/compaction


================================================================================
STATISTICAL SUMMARY
================================================================================

All relationships show statistically significant trends (p < 0.05):
• Strongest predictor: Bulk Density for both Pb and As
• Moderate correlations (R = 0.4) for bulk density relationships
• Weak correlations (R = 0.2-0.3) for pH relationships
• Combined, these factors explain 20-24% of total variance
  (Other factors like organic matter, clay content, etc., also important)


================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

1. For contaminated site management:
   → PRIORITIZE soil structure and compaction control
   → Monitor and manage bulk density to reduce infiltration pathways
   → Use pH adjustment as supplementary control measure

2. For runoff mitigation:
   → Install barriers or treatments in low-density (porous) soil areas
   → Focus resources on zones with both low bulk density AND unfavorable pH
   → Consider soil amendments to increase bulk density in critical areas

3. For future monitoring:
   → Collect bulk density measurements along with chemical analyses
   → Map spatial variation in soil porosity
   → Integrate physical and chemical soil properties in risk models
